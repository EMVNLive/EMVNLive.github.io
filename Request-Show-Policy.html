<p class="intro_request_show_policy">Hey, if you have reached this part of the document, and have <span class="intro_marked">not</span> read the <a href="EMVN_Terms_of_Service.html">Terms of Service</a>, please go do so. This is an extension to that document, which deals with what the Administrators and Moderators ("We") call the "Request Show".</p>
<h1 class="request_show_policy_title">The Request Show Policy</h1>
<p class="request_show_policy_explained">The Request Show is an event held by the Epic Music VN Administrators, where the Members are allowed to choose the music being played on the Stream. Because of this, we have some rules in place to ensure that everyone are treated fairly during the event. You agree <span class="policy_marked">not</span> to:</p>
<ul>
	<li class="request_show_policy_list"><span class="policy_marked">Request any songs- or pieces that are longer than 5 minutes.</span> This is due to the fact that there usually are a big number of people during the Request Show, but there is a limited amount of time per show. Therefore, please refrain from requesting long songs- or pieces.</li>
	<li class="request_show_policy_list"><span class="policy_marked">Request any more than one request at once.</span> This is - like the previous rule - in place to ensure that everyone are able to request a songs- or piece during the Request Show. Posting multiple songs- or pieces at once, takes away requests from other Members.</li>
	<li class="request_show_policy_list"><span class="policy_marked">Request anything outside the Epic Music genre.</span> Epic Music VN is an Epic Music channel, and people are there to listen to Epic Music, and not something else. Therefore, please don't request anything outside the Epic Music genre.</li>
</ul>
<p class="request_show_policy_explained">Furthermore, there are a few things which are not something you are forced to do, but something that makes it easier for the Epic Music VN Administrators to process your request. Firstly, <span class="policy_marked">tag Epic Music VN in the Chatbox,</span> whenever you request. It helps them see the message. Secondly, <span class="policy_marked">post your request in ARTIST - TRACK format</span>, which also helps the Epic Music VN Administrators find your track more easily. </p>
